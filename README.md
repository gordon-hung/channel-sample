# channel-sample
The System.Threading.Channels namespace provides a set of synchronization data structures for passing data between producers and consumers asynchronously. The library targets .NET Standard and works on all .NET implementations.

This library is available in the System.Threading.Channels NuGet package. However, if you're using .NET Core 3.0 or later, the package is included as part of the framework.
